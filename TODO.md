# To-dos

Things I should do. At some point.

- Make the initial setup nicer; you shouldn't have to manually run the `ui` script
- ~~`tmux` setup~~
- `vscode` settings and extensions
- `terminal` and `ghostty` configs
- Centralize the check for operating system and logic surrounding
- `git worktree`

- Test commit #1
