Dotfiles and general setup for a new PC

## Software

Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to do any and all software installations. It makes installing and updating software as simple as running `choco install ...` which will really speed up the process.

Make sure to grab key browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave), Slack, Notion, Cmder, Neovim, Notepad++, GitHub Desktop, and VSCode. Also install Node, Yarn, and Python. Use the Windows Store to grab Trello, Todoist, and Spotify. I also highly recommend setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Here's a easy to follow configuration video from [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-atblwgc63E). Grab basic command line utilities like wget, cURL, youtube-dl, PuTTY, and Git. 

Grab the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, Steam, Blizzard, Origin and UPlay as well. Install Logitech GHub and Logitech Options to configure your gear. Grab VLC, Greenshot, 7-Zip, and Irfanview. Change your default Windows apps.

Setup the Microsoft Phone app for interaction with your Android device from your computer.

## File Structure

Chocolatey will keep software organized. Keep everything in folders. The `Downloads` folder should have a bin for repositories that is cleaned out periodically. Keep `Photos` and `Downloads` clean as they tend to get cluttered. Backup your files to Dropbox and your SSD as often as needed.

## Neovim

For now, basically follow [this](https://jdhao.github.io/2018/11/15/neovim_configuration_windows/) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2prsFrKwbOo), use [this](https://github.com/Optixal/neovim-init.vim/blob/master/init.vim), and you should be able to use nvim. I'll flesh it out more in the future.

I also recommmend changing `cmder's` style in settings.

## VSCode
