# dotfiles

Includes the dotfiles I use for nvim, WSL 2, ZSH, and PowerShell.

For any required software installations, I highly recommend using Chocolatey.

## vim

I use [ThePrimeagen's dotfile](https://github.com/erkrnt/awesome-streamerrc/tree/master/ThePrimeagen) with Neovim.

To install YouCompleteMe, follow the README and then run this:

`python install.py --clang-completer --all --msvc=15`

## VS Code

I use Settings Sync, a newly added VS Code feature, but I've included my settings as well.
